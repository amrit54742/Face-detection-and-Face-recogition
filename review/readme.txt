In order to recognize person face , we gotta train our model by using 10 to 15 images of that particular individual. We have create one folder name "photos"
inside the folder where both files(fun.py and facedet.py) are placed. 

Then, we need to add a new folder (name of the individual) and paste 10 to 15 images of that individual in that folder.

NOTE: Folder name should be same as individual name.

Python file(fun.py) will be used to train the model and after training the model , we can use python file(facedet.py) to recognize individual face.
